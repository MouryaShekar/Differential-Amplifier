# Differential-Amplifier
1. Introduction
A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting any signals that are common to both inputs. It is a core component in various electronic systems, particularly in signal processing, instrumentation, and communication systems. It plays a crucial role in applications where it is important to measure the difference between two signals, while suppressing any common-mode noise or interference that might affect both inputs equally.

2. Working Principle
The differential amplifier works on the principle of amplifying the difference between two input voltages: \[ V_out = A_d (V_1 - V_2) \]
